## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```
[ React Frontend ]  <-->  [ Express.js API ]  <-->  [ MongoDB Atlas ]
        |                          |                    |
        |--- Google Gemini AI -----|--- Google Vision --|
        |                          |                    |
    (Google Cloud Run: frontend & backend containers)
```

- **Frontend:** React 18, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn-ui
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas, Google Gemini AI, Google Vision API
- **Authentication:** Supabase (for journal and user data)
- **Deployment:** Google Cloud Run (frontend and backend as separate services)

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Data & AI

- **Public Dataset:** 500+ natural remedies, curated from open-access medical literature.
- **MongoDB Atlas:** Flexible, scalable document database with advanced Atlas Search (compound, fuzzy, wildcard, phrase, and vector-ready).
- **Google Gemini AI:** Summarizes remedies, interprets prescriptions, powers health chat.
- **Google Vision API:** OCR for prescriptions and health documents.
- **Supabase:** Secure user authentication and journal storage.

---

## ‚ö°Ô∏è How It Works

1. **User searches for a remedy, uploads a prescription, or asks a health question.**
2. **Backend runs MongoDB Atlas Search** (text, fuzzy, wildcard, phrase, or vector search) on the relevant collection.
3. **Google Vision API** (if image) extracts text from prescriptions.
4. **Google Gemini AI** generates summaries, explanations, or chat responses.
5. **Frontend displays AI-enriched results** with actionable health information.

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js, npm/yarn
- MongoDB Atlas cluster
- Google Cloud account (Gemini & Vision API)
- Supabase project (for authentication & journal)

### Backend
```bash
cd server
npm install
# Add .env with MongoDB URI, Gemini API Key, Vision credentials, Supabase keys
npm start
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
# Add .env with API base URL and Supabase keys
npm run dev
```

### Cloud Deployment
- Use provided Dockerfiles and `gcloud` commands to deploy both services to Google Cloud Run.
- All environment variables (API keys, URIs) are securely managed in Cloud Run settings.

---

## üîí Security & Privacy

- All sensitive data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS).
- No private health data is shared with third parties.
- User authentication and journal entries are secured with Supabase.
- AI services (Gemini, Vision) are used for on-demand inference and never store user data.

---

## üß© Extensibility

- **Modular Backend:** Easily add new endpoints for nutrition, symptom checker, or telehealth.
- **Pluggable Frontend:** Add new pages and components for future features.
- **Vector Search Ready:** Platform supports semantic and similarity-based health search.
